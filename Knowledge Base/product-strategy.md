## Product Strategy and Roadmapping

### The "Services-to-SaaS" Pivot Strategy (Zebra)
*   **The Challenge:** Transitioning from a billable-hours service model to a recurring revenue SaaS model requires funding product development while maintaining cash flow from client work.
*   **The "Harvesting" Framework:**
    *   **Identification:** Analyzed feature requests across 5+ enterprise clients to identify common denominators. If a feature was requested by multiple clients (e.g., inventory management for legacy backends), it became a candidate for productization.
    *   **Standardization:** Built the "core" feature set to be sellable to the broader market, with client-specific requirements handled as minor, paid configurations on top.
    *   **Financial Modeling:** Structured the roadmap by projecting the initial investment (time/dollars) against the required annual recurring revenue (ARR) needed to break even. Only products where the projected ARR quickly offset the "harvesting" cost were approved. Defined and executed the complete pricing structure and strategy.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully launched a SaaS inventory product that generated **$6M ARR**, funded entirely by "harvested" billable work.

### Greenfield Strategy: The "10x" Redesign (Veranex)
*   **Context:** Inherited a site with 0.001% conversion and no strategy.
*   **The 4-Phase Strategic Roadmap:**
    1.  **Pain Point Discovery:** Conducted heuristic evaluations and information flow mapping to identify critical friction points.
    2.  **Value Proposition Alignment:** Redesigned the Information Architecture (IA) to ensure the core value props of each business unit—previously buried—were surfaced immediately.
    3.  **Conversion Optimization:** Focused specifically on the transaction point (the form). Simplified fields and implemented enrichment tools to reduce user effort.
    4.  **Traffic Generation:** Once the "bucket" was fixed (conversion), opened the "faucet" (traffic) via targeted social, SEO-driven blogging, and email campaigns.
*   **Result:** A systematic increase in conversion from **0.001% to 1.4%**.

### Prioritization & Managing Stakeholders
*   **The "Hard No" (Zebra):**
    *   **Scenario:** An internal executive pushed for a niche feature in a SaaS vision system product that had no market demand beyond a single instance.
    *   **Resolution:** Used financial modeling to demonstrate that the feature would be a net loss.
    *   **The Pivot:** Delivered a "No" to the specific feature but offered an alternative feature that met the executive's underlying goal while remaining market-viable. This preserved the product's P&L while giving the stakeholder a visible "win."
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
    *   Every roadmap decision was validated against the custom Power BI financial dashboard. Features were prioritized based on real-time revenue potential and market demand, ensuring development resources were always allocated to high-ROI activities.

### Hybrid Roadmapping: Agile Execution in a Waterfall World
*   **Reverse Engineering for Dates:**
    *   **MVP Definition:** When executive constraints demand a fixed "Go Live" date (Waterfall), the roadmap is built backward. Identify the absolute minimum scope that *can* be delivered by the date with high confidence.
    *   **Confidence Horizons:** All other features are categorized as "Nice to Haves." If the scope is untenable for the date, this framework forces an immediate trade-off conversation (cut scope, move date, or add capacity) *before* the project begins, rather than at the deadline.
*   **Budget-Driven Agility:**
    *   For internal productization efforts (where budget/resources are the constraint), use Agile Poker Planning to estimate capacity.
    *   **Scope Selection:** Evaluate potential features against market demand intensity. The roadmap becomes a function of "Highest Value Features that fit within Capacity."

### Strategic Turnaround: The First 90 Days (Veranex Interim Head of Marketing)
*   **Approach:** "Fixing the plane while flying it."
*   **Execution:**
    1.  **Rhetoric to Reality:** Conducted an immediate workshop to translate high-level corporate goals into concrete, actionable tasks.
    2.  **Impact/Effort Matrix:** Collaboratively ranked initiatives with the team.
    3.  **Sequencing Success:**
        *   **Immediate:** Assigned resources to "High Impact / Low Effort" tasks to generate quick wins and build momentum.
        *   **Pipeline:** Simultaneously started work streams on "High Impact / Medium Effort" tasks to ensure a continuous delivery of value once the low-hanging fruit was harvested.
