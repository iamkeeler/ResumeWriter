## Team Building, Mentorship, and Talent Development

### Structured Hiring & Onboarding
*   **The "300% Growth" Sprint (Veranex):** Hired 6 UX designers in one year while maintaining high billable utilization.
    *   **Onboarding Ramp:** Developed a structured Miro and Figma-based onboarding roadmap with specific milestones at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months.
    *   **Buddy System:** Paired every new hire with a senior mentor for shadow-work on active client projects. This allowed new hires to contribute to billable work immediately under supervision, accelerating their "time-to-billable" metric.
    *   **"Culture Add" Assessment:** Implemented the "Beers Test" (social compatibility) as a team-based assessment metric—asking "Would we want to learn more about this person socially?"—to ensure new hires brought positive energy and curiosity, not just technical skills.

### Mentorship & Leadership Development
*   **Developing High-Potential (HiPo) Talent:**
    *   **Strategy:** Identified HiPo individuals who lacked confidence and assigned specific "stretch assignments" (e.g., leading a client pitch).
    *   **Safety Net:** Acted as the "safety blanket" in the room—allowing the mentee to lead without interruption, then conducting a structured debrief/retro immediately after to reinforce wins and coach on improvements.
    *   **Outcome:** Successfully transitioned individual contributors into confident client-facing leads.
*   **The Internship Pipeline (ITR Mobility):**
    *   **Structure:** Built a robust internship program with a ~50% conversion rate to full-time hire.
    *   **Qualification:** No artificial "final exam"—interns were integrated into real client work. Hiring decisions were based on cumulative performance on shipping production-level features.

### Design Culture & Psychological Safety
*   **Critique Framework:** Established a critique culture that avoided "roast sessions" by enforcing a "Solution-Oriented" rule.
    *   **Rule:** "You cannot point out a problem without offering a potential solution." (e.g., "I don't like the button radius; have you tried X?").
    *   **Methodology:** Utilized frameworks like "I Like, I Wish, I Wonder" and dot-voting to democratize feedback and ensure it remained constructive and directional.

### Performance Management & Turnarounds
*   **Coaching Underperformance:**
    *   **Approach:** successfully turned around a senior-level employee who was operating with a junior mindset (lack of ownership).
    *   **Method:** instituted an informal 6-month coaching plan rooted in the specific job description.
    *   **Empathy:** Framed the conversation around "Team Health"—emphasizing that high performance is a collective responsibility. Focused one-on-ones specifically on "What does ownership look like in this scenario?" rather than punitive measures.
    *   **Result:** The employee successfully transitioned into the ownership required of their senior title.

### Global Remote Management
*   **Building Connection:**
    *   **Rituals:** Implemented specific "Team Huddles" with dedicated time protected for non-work banter.
    *   **Philosophy:** Recognized that in distributed teams, "water cooler" moments must be intentional. Creating space for daily, informal interaction proved critical for maintaining team cohesion across time zones.
