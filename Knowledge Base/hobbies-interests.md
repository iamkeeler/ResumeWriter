## Hobbies and Personal Interests

### The "Builder" Mindset
*   **Physical Creation:** Passionate about understanding how things work by building and fixing them.
    *   **Woodworking & Fabrication:** Regular use of 3D printing and CNC machining. Recently designed, machined, powder-coated, and marketed a line of aluminum yo-yos with a partner. Currently prototyping a pocket-sized cribbage board.
    *   **Board Game Development:** In the process of developing an original board game, handling every aspect from writing rule sets and interaction mechanics to 3D printing pieces and manufacturing prototype cards/boards for playtesting.
    *   **Repair:** An active "fixer" around the house, driven by a desire to deconstruct and understand mechanical systems.

### Creative Outlets & Decompression
*   **Art as Decompression:** Creativity is the primary method for disconnection and resilience.
    *   **Mediums:** Active practitioner of photography, watercolor, acrylics, printmaking, and digital painting on iPad.
    *   **Production Process:** Owns and operates a high-quality art printing workflow. The process—from digital painting to color correction, paper selection, calibration, and printing—is a meditative practice.
    *   **Business of Art:** Manages the end-to-end lifecycle of art sales, including designing custom packaging (wax seals, certificates of authenticity) and selling prints at local art fairs and businesses.
*   **Daily Habit:** Always carries pen and paper for sketching and capturing inspiration in the moment.

### Community & Faith Leadership
*   **Podcast Production:** Producer for *Hearts for the Kingdom*, a Christian life podcast hosted by his wife. (Since 3/18/24)
    *   **Role:** Handles full-stack digital production: audio engineering (cleaning/processing), distribution channel management (Spotify, Apple, Amazon), graphic design, and marketing asset creation.
    *   **Professional Synergy:** Leveraged this personal podcasting experience to successfully launch a corporate podcast initiative at work.
*   **Volunteer Leadership:**
    *   **Church:** Leads the announcements team and volunteers in kids' ministry. Former youth pastor/leader for middle and high school groups.
    *   **Education:** Regular guest speaker at **UW-Stout**, providing professional critiques and industry insights to design students. Also speaks to middle school art groups about the artistic process and career paths.

### Family Influence on Tech Philosophy
*   **"Dad Mode" Insight:** Observing his daughter's interactions with technology has deeply influenced his professional philosophy.
*   **Mission:** Committed to creating technology that is safe and growth-oriented for the next generation, countering the trend of "attention-pulling" digital experiences that offer little value. This drives a focus on meaningful, value-add product design.
