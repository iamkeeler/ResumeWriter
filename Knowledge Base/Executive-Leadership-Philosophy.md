## Executive Leadership & Philosophy

### Resilience & Failure Management
*   **The "Financial Disaster" (Hy-Vee):** While the *client relationship* was saved and the product launched, the project was a financial failure for the agency, overrunning the budget by **5x** due to poor initial scope definition.
    *   **The Fix:** Had to negotiate internally to have other profitable projects subsidize the loss.
    *   **The Lesson:** This failure radically overhauled the approach to **Change Management**. Instituted a policy of immediate, clear documentation and transparent client communication the moment a project deviates from scope, ensuring recovery plans are collaborative rather than reactive.
*   **External Dependencies (Sage Therapeutics):** Delivered a successful digital product strategy, but the initiative ultimately halted when the client failed to receive FDA approval for the drug.
    *   **Takeaway:** Reinforced the reality that in healthcare/MedTech, excellent digital execution is still subject to regulatory outcomes.

### Financial Acumen & Crisis Management
*   **Automated Financial Reporting Transformation (Zebra):**
    *   **Challenge:** Inherited a manual, fragile reporting process for bi-weekly executive "commit calls" that relied on static PowerPoint slides and a legacy Excel sheet which critically failed within two weeks of taking the role.
    *   **Action:** Personally architected a real-time financial intelligence platform using **Power BI**.
        *   Designed the dashboard UX and wrote complex **DAX formulas** to clean and merge disparate data sources (project financials, anonymized salaries, expenses).
        *   Shifted the workflow from "building slides" to "data storytelling," allowing executives to view real-time targets, upsides, and downsides on demand.
    *   **Outcome:** The system was so effective at providing clear, real-time visibility that the broader organization migrated onto this platform, replacing the legacy manual reporting structure.
*   **Budget Strategy:** When faced with mandates to reduce costs, prioritizes **preserving headcount** by aggressively reworking financials to cut technical debt, contractor spend, or low-ROI marketing initiatives instead.
*   **Crisis Communication (Veranex Layoffs):**
    *   **Scenario:** Executive leadership mandated a ~50% reduction in the UX team.
    *   **Action:** Executed the difficult task of identifying candidates for reduction. Immediately following the cut, was transferred to lead Marketing but returned to the remaining UX team to help rebuild morale and culture, demonstrating a commitment to the *people* beyond the reporting structure.

### AI Philosophy: "Adapt or Fall Behind"
*   **Stance:** AI is no longer optional; it is a necessity for speed and competitiveness.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Design:** Essential for rapid high-fidelity prototyping and exploring iterations faster than humanly possible manually.
    *   **Copywriting:** Critical for enforcing brand voice consistency (when trained on guidelines) and idea generation.
    *   **Marketing:** A force multiplier for image and concept generation.
*   **Core Belief:** AI acts as an "incredibly smart assistant" that amplifies human intuition. It doesn't replace the strategic thought, but it dramatically accelerates the execution.
