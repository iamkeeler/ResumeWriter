# Knowledge Base

This directory serves as the "brain" for the Resume Writer agent. It should contain all your career history, skills, projects, and achievements in standard Markdown format.

## How to Use
1.  **Use `template.md`**: Start by copying `template.md` to a new file (e.g., `profile.md`) and filling in your details.
2.  **Add Evidence**: Create additional markdown files for specific projects, talks, or deep-dives into specific skills (e.g., `project-alpha.md`, `leadership-philosophy.md`).
3.  **PDF Support**: You can also drop your existing PDF resumes or performance reviews here. The agent will attempt to read them, but Markdown is preferred for accuracy.

## Example Files
**Note:** The existing files in this directory (e.g., `00_Professional-profile.md`, etc.) are **EXAMPLES ONLY** based on a fictional or sample profile.
-   **Review them** to understand the level of detail and formatting expected.
-   **Delete or Move them** once you have populated your own data, so the agent doesn't mix your history with the example data.
