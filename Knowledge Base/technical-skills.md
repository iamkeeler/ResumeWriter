## Technical Skills and Tools

### Design & Prototyping
*   **Design Systems (The "Golden Stack"):**
    *   **Primary:** **Figma** (Source of Truth) + **Figma Dev Mode** (Handoff).
    *   **Prototyping:** **Axure** (for complex logic/high-fidelity) and direct **Code-Based Prototyping** (encouraged for speed and fidelity).
    *   **Legacy Experience:** Zeplin, PenPot, Adobe XD.
*   **Proficiency:** Expert (5/5) in defining token structures and maintaining App Style Guides for scalable component libraries.

### Product Management & Agile Tooling
*   **Roadmapping & Execution:**
    *   **Platform Agnostic:** Highly adaptable to organizational standards, with deep expertise in **Azure DevOps (ADO)** (4/5 proficiency, including full environment setup and management), **Jira**, and **Asana**.
*   **Strategy:** Utilizes these tools not just for ticketing, but for managing the entire product lifecycle from "Poker Planning" estimation to sprint velocity tracking.

### Development & Data (Hands-On Proficiency)
*   **Frontend Engineering:**
    *   **CSS/SCSS/Tailwind:** **4/5** (Can architect layouts and fix complex styling bugs in production).
    *   **JS Frameworks (React/Vue):** **3/5** (Can build components and prototype interactions).
    *   **CMS Philosophy:** Strong preference for **WordPress** over HubSpot CMS due to flexibility and the plugin ecosystem. Believes the "HubSpot Lock-in" limits velocity compared to a decoupled architecture (WordPress Front-end + HubSpot CRM Back-end).
*   **Data & Analytics:**
    *   **SQL/DAX:** **4/5** (Capable of writing complex queries from scratch; architected the Zebra Power BI financial dashboard).
    *   **Analytics Stack:** **GA4** (Quantitative) layered with **Hotjar** (Qualitative Heatmapping).

### MarTech & Growth Stack
*   **CRM & Automation:** **HubSpot Enterprise** (Architect level).
*   **Enrichment & Intelligence:**
    *   **Stack:** **Clearbit (Breeze Intelligence)** for form enrichment, **ZoomInfo**, **Apollo**, **Pitchbook**, **Wiza**.
    *   **Strategy:** Uses enrichment to reduce form fields, directly impacting conversion rates (e.g., the Veranex 1400% increase).

### AI & Future Tech
*   **Daily Workflow:**
    *   **Coding:** **GitHub Copilot** (integrated into VS Code).
    *   **Research:** **Perplexity** (Primary engine).
    *   **LLMs:** **ChatGPT**, **Claude** (Anthropic), **Google Gemini** (Backend integration), and local LLMs via **Ollama** (Meta Llama 3).
    *   **Creative:** **Merlin AI** (Image generation & model aggregation).
