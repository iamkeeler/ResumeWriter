## Thought Leadership

### Speaking & Public Talks
*   **Conference Talks:**
    *   **"Burning Out and How to Deal With It"** – A candid, tactical talk on recognizing burnout, setting boundaries, and building sustainable careers in design and tech.
    *   **"What To Do When Everyone Looks To You"** – A practical talk on becoming a manager, shifting from IC work to leadership, and handling the weight of responsibility.
*   **Availability:**
    *   **Slides:** Published in full on GitHub as downloadable slide decks and reference material.
    *   **Recordings:** Previously available on Vimeo and Pluralsight-style platforms (availability subject to hosting partners).

### Writing & Content Channels
*   **Topics Covered:**
    *   Design systems and how to operationalize them inside real organizations (not just as static libraries).
    *   Remote leadership, including the hidden cultural costs of remote-first teams and how to intentionally rebuild connection.
    *   UX, product, and MarTech integration: turning user insight and data into measurable pipeline and revenue.
*   **Formats:**
    *   **LinkedIn:** 2–4 posts per week on design leadership, AI in design, and current work-in-progress projects.
    *   **Medium & Personal Blog:** Occasional longer-form reflections on design practice and career growth.
    *   **YouTube:** Supporting content for tools and templates (e.g., FiveMinute countdowns) and workflow demonstrations.

### Emerging Focus Areas
*   **AI & Design (Primary Future Track):**
    *   Intends to publish a series on **practical and ethical AI use in design**—how to treat AI as a force multiplier rather than a crutch.
    *   Focus on workflows for brainstorming, research synthesis, and code-adjacent prototyping where AI augments, not replaces, designer judgment.
*   **Contrarian & Nuanced Takes:**
    *   **"Why I Don’t Recommend Figma for Everyone":** Argues that Figma’s growing complexity makes it a poor fit for some teams, and that tools like Axure or direct code prototyping can be better for complex logic or regulated environments.
    *   **"The Hidden Costs of Remote-First Design Teams":** Plans to explore culture erosion, mentorship gaps, and the intentional rituals required to counteract them.

### Future Platforms & Goals
*   **Podcasts:** Actively interested in guest appearances on design, product, and leadership podcasts to discuss:
    *   AI-literate design teams
    *   Burnout and sustainable leadership
    *   Bridging UX, MarTech, and revenue
*   **Cadence Goal:** 3–5 touchpoints per week across LinkedIn and other channels, mixing:
    *   In-progress product and tooling work
    *   Short, tactical leadership lessons
    *   Commentary on AI, UX, and the future of design work
