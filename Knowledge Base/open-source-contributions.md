## Open Source Contributions

### Developer & Design Tools

*   **UXTOOLTIME-Axure & Framer:**
    *   **Problem:** Axure and Framer (in its code-based era) lacked native Material Design mobile widgets, creating inconsistency and slowing down mobile prototyping.
    *   **Contribution:** Built and open-sourced a comprehensive library of iOS and Android widgets.
    *   **Impact:** Achieved **~60,000 downloads** and **86 forks** on GitHub before sunsetting, becoming a staple resource for the Axure community.

*   **FiveMinute (Timer Templates):**
    *   **Problem:** Creating custom countdown timers for presentations and videos was a manual, repetitive pain point for creators.
    *   **Contribution:** Developed and released open-source timer templates for Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.
    *   **Impact:** The accompanying YouTube resource has garnered **669,000+ views/downloads**, widely adopted by the creator community.

*   **MarkTo (Markdown to RTF Converter):**
    *   **Problem:** Copying content from AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude) into word processors (Word, Outlook) often breaks formatting.
    *   **Solution:** Built a utility that accepts Markdown (the AI standard) and converts it to Rich Text Format (RTF) in the clipboard, ensuring consistent, clean pasting into legacy enterprise tools.

*   **ColorKeep (Mac Menu Bar Utility):**
    *   **Problem:** Designers constantly copy/paste hex codes but lose track of previously used colors.
    *   **Solution:** Created a menu bar app that monitors the clipboard for hex codes, automatically saving them into a history list. Features include pinning, library export/import via text files, and one-click copying.

*   **MDL-Boilerplate:**
    *   **Contribution:** Maintained a starter framework for Google's Material Design Lite, integrated with SCSS to accelerate setup for developers bridging the design-dev gap. (Now deprecated).

### Game Development

*   **Brick Run (Wear OS Game):**
    *   **Role:** Solo Developer (Concept, Design, Code, Graphics).
    *   **Concept:** A roguelike brick-breaking game designed specifically for the constraints of a smartwatch (circular screen, digital crown control).
    *   **UX Strategy:** Designed for **"micro-sessions" (30 seconds)** to match wearable use cases. Solved interaction challenges by using the digital crown for paddle control to keep fingers off the small screen.
    *   **Status:** Currently in closed testing for the Google Play Store. Features procedural difficulty scaling, 40+ upgrades, and 8 ball types.

### Community & Thought Leadership

*   **Speaker Decks & Artifacts:**
    *   **Topics:** "Scaling Design Teams," "Burnout Management," and "Leadership Under Pressure."
    *   **Availability:** Full slide decks and resources are open-sourced on GitHub for community use.
*   **AI Workflow Automation:**
    *   **Internal Tooling:** Developed personal automation workflows using VS Code and GitHub Copilot to semantically process meeting transcripts into structured knowledge bases, reducing administrative friction.
