# Conference Speaking & Thought Leadership

## Speaking Strategy & Philosophy
*   **Primary Objective:** Thought Leadership. The core motivation is "pouring back" into the community to reciprocate the value received from it.
*   **Secondary Objectives:** Talent acquisition, brand building, and networking. While not always resulting in direct hires, speaking engagements have successfully facilitated job placements for peers and expanded the professional network.

## Key Presentation Topics

### 1. "Burning Out and How to Deal with It"
*   **Venues:** Midwest UX, THAT Conference, Minnesota Developers Conference (MDC).
*   **Audience:** Developers and Designers.
*   **Origin:** Born from a personal period of professional burnout and lack of passion. A challenge from a conference speaker prompted a shift from passive burnout to active resolution.
*   **Core Methodology:**
    *   **The "12 Books" Challenge:** committed to reading one non-design business book per month for a year to expand skills and rekindle interest.
    *   **"Inspiration Fuel":** Creating a repository of inspiring visuals/ideas to reference during low periods.
*   **Key Takeaways:** Focused on identifying early warning signs of burnout, validating the audience's shared experiences, and providing actionable tools for prevention.
*   **Feedback:** Attendees resonated with the validation of their experiences and the practical vocabulary provided to identify and discuss burnout.

### 2. "Becoming a Leader: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You"
*   **Context:** Design Leadership and Team Scaling.
*   **Core Thesis:** Distinguishing leadership from management. Leadership is defined as the ability to inspire and gather people toward a shared goal, regardless of title.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **"Be the Leader You Want to See":** Encouraging proactive leadership rather than waiting for permission.
    *   **Planned Reactions:** Preparing for leadership moments in advance to avoid snap judgments during critical situations.
    *   **Recognizing Opportunities:** Identifying subtle moments (e.g., guiding a group meeting) to exercise leadership.
*   **Impact:** Proven track record of building tightly knit, high-retention cultures; former team members maintain contact over a decade later.

### 3. "Team Culture, Design Systems, and Scalable Design Operations"
*   **Venue:** THAT Conference.
*   **Context:** Delivered during the early/novel phase of Design Systems adoption.
*   **Scope:** Covered technical execution (tokens, components, variants) alongside the critical "human" elements: cultural adoption, education, and documentation.
*   **Case Study (Scalable Ops):** *Ecolab (via ITR Mobility)*
    *   **Challenge:** Three separate software teams working on distinct projects that required a unified platform feel.
    *   **Solution:** Implemented a shared component library and interaction patterns.
    *   **Operational Technique:** Established routine "cross-pollination" meetups where designers reviewed new components and shared use cases to unify the design language across teams.

### 4. Specialized MedTech & Healthcare UX
*   **Role Breakdown:**
    *   **Facilitator:** For highly technical/regulatory webinars (e.g., "Drug Delivery," "EU MDR"), acting as a host rather than the primary Subject Matter Expert (SME).
    *   **SME Speaker:** For Design/UX specific talks.
*   **Key Themes:**
    *   **Physical Context:** Emphasizing that MedTech software design must account for the physical environment (e.g., a high-stress cardiac arrest in the field vs. a therapist with 5 minutes in an office).
    *   **Speed & Efficiency:** Critical usability in high-stakes environments.

## Future Speaking Goals
*   **Target Topics:** AI in MedTech and AI in Enterprise Software.
*   **Focus Area:** The evolution of "Adaptive UI"—interfaces that utilize AI to identify and reduce friction points automatically, creating deeply personalized user experiences.
