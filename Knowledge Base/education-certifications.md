## Education and Certifications

### Formal Education
*   **Bachelor of Fine Arts - Graphic Design** | *University of Wisconsin - Stout* (Menomonie, WI, 2011)
    *   **Relevance:** Provided foundational mastery in typography, grid systems, and color theory—skills that remain critical even in digital product leadership (e.g., ensuring cohesive branding across software, marketing materials, and physical event spaces).
    *   **Application:** Bridges traditional design principles with modern technology. *Example:* Utilized a Meta Quest 3 headset to visualize and scale 10-foot conference booth graphics in AR, allowing for accurate physical scale assessment without printing costs.
*   **Bachelor of Theology** | *Life Christian University* (2015)
    *   **Leadership Impact:** Deeply informs a "Servant Leadership" philosophy. The study of theology reinforces the belief that every individual deserves intrinsic respect, directly shaping an empathetic, ethical management style that prioritizes team needs alongside business goals.

### Continuous Learning & Self-Directed Education
*   **Professional Development:**
    *   **Agile/Scrum:** Completed multiple formal training courses on Agile methodologies and design sprints.
    *   **Analytics:** Completed Google Analytics certification and HubSpot University modules.
    *   **Technical Skills:** Self-taught coding capabilities, resulting in the publication of two personal applications (with a third in development) to better understand developer constraints.
*   **"The 12 Books" Challenge:** A personal initiative to combat burnout by reading one non-design business book per month. Key influences include:
    *   *The Making of a Manager* by Julie Zhuo: Shifted mindset from "individual contributor" to "force multiplier"—measuring success by the team's output, not personal credit.
    *   *Essentialism* by Greg McKeown: Instilled the discipline of the "strategic no"—rejecting good opportunities to focus exclusively on the few high-value initiatives that drive progress.
    *   *Pitch Anything* by Oren Klaff: Provided psychological frameworks for framing ideas and storytelling to ensure messages land effectively with stakeholders.
    *   *Creativity, Inc.* by Ed Catmull: Taught that mistakes should prompt process improvement, not blame. *Lesson:* Focus on preventing future errors (systemic fixes) rather than hunting for culprits, fostering a culture of psychological safety.

### Mentorship as Education
*   **Philosophy:** Mentorship is a bilateral learning channel. Preparation for mentoring sessions often requires refreshing knowledge on older topics or researching new trends to ensure advice is current and relevant.
*   **Case Study:** While mentoring a designer working on a Mayo Clinic medical history app, the mentee proposed a novel interaction pattern for family tree data entry. This prompted a deep-dive research session into that specific pattern, broadening the leader's own design vocabulary and resulting in a superior user solution.
