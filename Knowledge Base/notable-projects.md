## Notable Projects and Case Studies

### Enterprise Modernization & Turnarounds

*   **Hy-Vee: Deep Orange Turnaround**
    *   **Challenge:** A migration of legacy Windows Mobile apps to Android was failing ("Deep Orange"). Legacy hardware was dying, and the app had significant technical debt.
    *   **Turnaround:** Inherited the failing project and conducted a high-stakes rebasing with client leadership. The core UX decision was not just to "port" the app, but to leverage the larger Android screen for "glanceability"—reducing the cognitive load and time associates spent staring at the device.
    *   **Outcome:** Stabilized the project and delivered the Android application now used in **every Hy-Vee store nationwide**.

*   **Ross Dress for Less: Nationwide Operations Migration**
    *   **Challenge:** Complete migration of all store operations (inventory, receiving, markdowns, jewelry exceptions) from legacy Windows to Android.
    *   **Approach:** Ran agile design sprints with UX working two weeks ahead of engineering. Replicated every single feature of the legacy system within a modern Android context while dealing with legacy code constraints.
    *   **Outcome:** Delivered a stable, fully functional application that runs **all store operations for Ross Dress for Less nationwide**.

*   **Amazon: Warehouse Setup Optimization**
    *   **Challenge:** New warehouse setup was bottlenecked by a 40% inventory readiness rate (only 20k of 50k shelving units ready at launch).
    *   **Solution:** Designed a language-agnostic, scan-driven interface for mobile workstations used by overseas vendors to pre-scan inventory. Innovated the "Sunburst" UI—a spatial interface using QR codes around the monitor bezel to allow navigation purely via scanner, eliminating the need for keyboards or language translation.
    *   **Outcome:** **>100% increase in productivity**, ensuring 100% of shelving units were ready at launch. The system processed over **1 million scans** in its first 6 months.

*   **Walmart Optical: The SaaS Pivot**
    *   **Challenge:** Walmart needed to modernize inventory scanning with new Android hardware without replacing their antiquated backend system.
    *   **Solution:** Designed a "bridge" app that synced modern Android scans with the legacy text-based backend.
    *   **Impact:** Delivered ahead of schedule/budget. Crucially, this project identified a market-wide need for "lightweight inventory management for legacy backends," leading to the creation of a **SaaS product** that generated **$6M in annual recurring revenue**.

### Digital Transformation & Strategy

*   **Veranex Website Redesign: 10x Lead Gen**
    *   **Challenge:** The v1.0 site had a conversion rate of 0.001% due to poor branding, confusing IA, and zero clear funnels.
    *   **Strategy:** Executed a complete overhaul focusing on a clear "hero" funnel and significantly reducing form friction (shorter fields, auto-enrichment).
    *   **Outcome:** Improved conversion rate to **1.4% (1400% increase)**, generating 60-70 qualified leads/month and driving a **$55M pipeline increase**.

*   **SuperValu: Mobile Ecosystem Redesign**
    *   **Challenge:** Disjointed mobile experience across the parent brand and 10 sub-brands.
    *   **Action:** Personally redesigned every screen for the consumer app and all 10 sub-brand apps. Visualized the massive scope by physically taping all screens to a wall at HQ, creating a "war room" that aligned stakeholders on the ecosystem's complexity.
    *   **Outcome:** Unified the digital experience for coupons, loyalty, and store finding across the entire portfolio.

*   **Ecolab: Unifying the "Ecolab 360" Platform**
    *   **Challenge:** Three independent product teams were building separate apps, threatening brand fragmentation and duplicated effort.
    *   **Strategy:** Created a shared component library. Convinced independent Product Owners to adopt it by proving it would reduce dev time while still allowing for "unique moments" specific to their use cases (e.g., washer programming vs. CRM).
    *   **Outcome:** successfully unified the UX across three distinct enterprise applications while maintaining strict brand guidelines.

### Innovation & Consumer Apps

*   **Postings for Craigslist (Consumer App)**
    *   **Achievement:** Designed and launched a 3rd-party Android app to "fix" Craigslist's ugly UI using Google's Material Design language.
    *   **Metrics:** Achieved **6 million downloads** and **2.5 million monthly active users**. Ranked as the #1 Craigslist app on the Google Play Store with overwhelmingly positive user feedback on the interface improvements.

*   **On Second Thought (Startup)**
    *   **Role:** Co-Founder & Design Lead.
    *   **Concept:** A messaging app allowing users to "recall" text messages before they were sent.
    *   **Recognition:** Featured on the **Inc. Magazine "30 Under 30" list**. Successfully raised pre-seed funding and pitched internationally.

*   **Sage Therapeutics: The "Ugly" Design Win**
    *   **Challenge:** Designing a companion app for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) treatment that needed to work for both patients and clinicians.
    *   **Insight:** A/B testing revealed that clinicians preferred a "uglier," integrated plugin that fit their existing workflow over a beautiful but separate web app.
    *   **Outcome:** Prioritized adoption over aesthetics, delivering the solution that clinicians would actually use.

### Healthcare & Specialized UX

*   **Medtronic: Mobile Sales Platform**
    *   **Challenge:** Empowering sales reps to sell complex medical devices in the field.
    *   **Solution:** Built a cross-platform framework to deploy iPad and Windows apps. Designed a catalog and ordering system that balanced "delight" with "reliability."
    *   **Impact:** The platform processed over **$1 billion in sales revenue**.

*   **Mayo Clinic: Family History App**
    *   **Challenge:** Inaccurate family history data due to cumbersome paper forms.
    *   **Innovation:** Mentored a designer to create a novel "Interactive Family Tree" UI. The app allowed patients to scroll through their lineage, tag conditions, and importantly, **share the tree with family members** (e.g., grandma) to crowdsource accurate medical history.
    *   **Outcome:** Highly praised by Mayo Clinic stakeholders and moved to internal development.

*   **Mayo Clinic: Surgical Innovation Keynote**
    *   **Role:** Thought Partner to Dr. Janini Reisenhauer (Head of Surgical Innovation).
    *   **Work:** Conducted ethnographic research in the operating room to visualize the "Surgical Theater of the Future." Crafted the narrative arc and visual design for her keynote speech using the Hero's Journey framework.
    *   **Outcome:** A critically acclaimed keynote that effectively communicated complex futuristic concepts to a surgical audience.
