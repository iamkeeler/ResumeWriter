## Leadership Achievements

### Organizational Turnaround & Pipeline Acceleration
*   **Achievement:** As Interim Head of Marketing at Veranex, successfully unified fragmented Strategy and Creative teams to drive a **$55M pipeline acceleration**.
*   **The Friction Point:** The Strategy team had ambitious high-level visions but lacked actionable frameworks, leading to "pipe dreams" that left the Creative team frustrated and directionless.
*   **The Fix:** Implemented a framework to break high-level goals into actionable execution chunks (campaigns, site updates, content). This operational clarity empowered the strategy team to give precise direction, resolving the friction.
*   **Impact:** **90%+** of the $55M pipeline growth was directly attributable to these operational changes and the resulting execution velocity.

### Crisis Leadership: Turning Around "Deep Orange" Projects
*   **Scenario:** At Zebra Technologies, inherited a failing ("Deep Orange") migration project for **Hy-Vee** (grocery chain). The contract promised "feature parity" to a legacy Windows Mobile app without defined specs, and hidden technical debt made the original deadline impossible.
*   **Action:**
    *   **Rebasing:** Conducted a high-stakes rebasing meeting with client leadership to transparently address the scope gap and negotiate a realistic timeline extension.
    *   **Visibility:** Instituted a tight cadence of progress check-ins, arming the client champion with the data needed to justify the delay to their own executives.
*   **Outcome:** Stabilized the project from "Deep Orange" to a manageable state, ultimately delivering the software that now powers **every Hy-Vee store nationwide**.

### Strategic Innovation: $6M Recurring Revenue Growth
*   **Achievement:** Successfully introduced a recurring revenue (SaaS) model within a traditional "billable hours" Professional Services organization at Zebra, adding **$6M in annual revenue**.
*   **The Strategy:** Overcame internal resistance to moving away from hourly billing by proposing a "co-op" development model.
*   **The Mechanism:** Convinced leadership to offer slightly lower project rates to select clients in exchange for IP rights. This allowed the team to use billable client projects to fund the development of scalable products, which were then packaged and sold as SaaS subscriptions to the broader market—effectively turning client service work into product R&D.

### Talent Development & Mentorship
*   **Approach:** Believes in "ownership with a safety net"—giving mentees responsibility for projects with room to fail, while acting as a backup to ensure ultimate success.
*   **Success Stories:**
    *   **From Intern to Senior:** Mentored a designer struggling with "imposter syndrome" confidence issues from fresh-out-of-college Intern to Senior Designer over 5 years. This individual remains a Senior Designer at Zebra today.
    *   **Career Launchpad:** Mentored **Monica Perkowitz** from Intern to Senior Designer. When she outgrew the internal opportunities, actively supported her transition to a new company to further her career growth, prioritizing the individual's trajectory over talent hoarding.

### Operational Efficiency: Design Governance Framework
*   **Achievement:** Implemented a design governance framework across 3 business units serving 700 employees.
*   **The Transformation:** Moved the brand from a "Wild West" state of inconsistency to a unified voice.
*   **Success Metric:** Success was measured by **Brand Unity**. By aligning agencies and internal teams under a single governance structure, Veranex was able to successfully pivot its market positioning to "Thought Leadership"—a critical differentiator for a services company where "people are the product." This consistency directly supported the brand's elevation in the market.
