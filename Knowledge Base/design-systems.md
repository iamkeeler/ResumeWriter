## Design Systems and Process Improvements

### Veranex Design System
*   **Structure:** Implemented an Atomic Design methodology, breaking components down to their smallest particles (atoms) and stacking them upwards. This allowed for rapid replication of pre-saved sections where individual elements (e.g., images, text) could be updated without breaking the layout.
*   **Governance:** Utilized a collaborative governance model with an external development partner (Sam Chae from Cleverbirds).
    *   **Workflow:** Proposed changes were bidirectional—either the developer suggesting implementation improvements or the internal team proposing new design patterns.
    *   **Approval:** Joint approval process between the internal design lead and the external partner ensured that every update to the system was both design-compliant and technically feasible.

### Documentation & Education
*   **The "Stack":** Relied on a self-contained documentation ecosystem within Figma.
    *   **Onboarding Pages:** Dedicated Figma pages guided new users through the system, linking component definitions directly to live examples and use cases.
*   **Onboarding Ritual:** New designers were required to complete a "build challenge" as part of their orientation—creating a quick prototype using only the design system. A senior designer would then review this work, using it as a constructive mentorship opportunity to reinforce best practices early.

### Process Improvement: Design Critique Culture
*   **Foundation:** Established through a team-wide workshop where "Team Norms" were co-created, not dictated.
    *   **Core Principle:** "Critique the work, not the person."
    *   **Holistic Approach:** Norms included well-being standards (e.g., "Bring your best self to work," encouraging time off when needed) to ensure critiques happened in a healthy mental environment.
*   **Outcome:** Because the team co-authored the rules, they felt ownership over the culture, leading to high psychological safety and more honest, productive feedback loops.

### ITR Mobility: Reducing Cycle Time by 40%
*   **The "Standardization" Secret:** The 40% reduction in cycle time was driven by bridging the knowledge gap between design and engineering.
    *   **Code Fluency:** Designers were trained on the basics of code structure, component logic, and data flows. This enabled them to design workflows that were inherently easier to implement.
    *   **Precision Handoffs:** Instead of vague visual specs, designers referenced specific component names (e.g., "Use `Input Field Variant B`" vs. "Use this text box"). This eliminated guesswork for developers, who no longer had to interpret visual intent into code components.
*   **Tooling Integration:** Designers worked directly in the same project management tools (Microsoft Azure DevOps/Visual Studio Online) as the developers, operating within the same Agile/Scrum cadences to ensure real-time alignment.

### Metrics & "Selling" the System
*   **Beyond Speed:** While shipping velocity (50% increase) was the headline metric, the system's value was also proven through quality and efficiency 
    *   **Quality:** Tracked the reduction in UI bugs and regression issues.
    *   **Efficiency:** monitored the number of revisions/iterations per feature.
*   **Executive Storytelling:** For each project, specific pain points were identified and linked directly to the design system's solution. These "success stories" were delivered to upper management to continuously justify the investment in system maintenance.
