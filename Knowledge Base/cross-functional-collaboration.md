## Cross-functional Collaboration and Stakeholder Management

### Core Philosophy: "No Designer Card"
A foundational principle is that design decisions must be justified with reason and data, not by title. Designers are coached to advocate for their work by "selling the value" and creating clear decision points, which removes emotion and fosters buy-in from all functions. This approach ensures designers are more successful and that collaboration is based on shared goals.

### Collaboration with Product Management
*   **The Partnership:** The ideal state is a symbiotic relationship where both PM and Design work with the end-user's benefit as the primary driver. The PM is actively aware of UX sprints, and designers are aware of broader project constraints (e.g., budget, timeline). This creates a balanced environment where product roadmaps, requirements, and feature prioritization are developed collaboratively, not dictated.
*   **Challenging Example (Genentech):** User research revealed that key features on the PM's roadmap were the lowest priority for end-users.
    *   **Action:** Multiple future-state workflows were designed to demonstrate the time/effort benefits of aligning with user needs. A final "bridge plan" was presented to the client, outlining a clear path to connect their highest-priority business features with the highest-value user features.
    *   **Key Learning:** The client stakeholder remained at arm's length, leading to surprises. The takeaway was the critical need for frequent, direct check-ins with not just the project PM but also the key executive stakeholder to ensure continuous alignment and avoid last-minute conflicts.

### Collaboration with Engineering
*   **The Handoff & Loop:** The process is built on the belief that designers must understand the technical frameworks (iOS, Android, CSS libraries) they are working within. This ensures that "out-of-the-box" controls are used whenever possible, reserving custom development only for critical, high-value features.
    *   **Process:** Handoffs utilize tools like Figma and Zeplin for clear documentation. In a mature process, designers can directly modify UI components in frameworks like React (e.g., colors, padding), closing the gap between design and implementation.
*   **Challenging Example (Mobile Slider):** A designer, unfamiliar with framework constraints, designed a unique slider control. The engineer spent two weeks trying to build it before a communication breakdown was identified.
    *   **Resolution:** The team reverted to a standard, out-of-the-box "tumbler" control, which met the need without the wasted effort.
    *   **Process Improvement:** Following this incident, a formal process of holding design reviews with engineers was implemented. This was paired with assigning specific technical learning to designers, creating both a cultural shift and a process-driven checkpoint to ensure feasibility is assessed early.

### Collaboration with Marketing & Sales
*   **Marketing Partnership:** Marketing is engaged early to assess the feasibility and differentiation of an idea. Product design and marketing strategy are developed in parallel, ensuring that the product's "why" is baked in from the start and accurately reflected in the go-to-market plan.
*   **Sales Partnership:** The sales team is treated as a critical source of frontline feedback. Regular check-ins (bi-weekly to quarterly) are used to gather insights on what will help them close deals. The design team provides "ammunition" by co-creating pitch decks, demos, and one-pagers that arm salespeople to effectively sell the value of the product and its design.
*   **Challenging Example (Zebra - Over-promising):** Certain salespeople would over-promise software capabilities to clients.
    *   **Action:** This was managed on a case-by-case basis. Trusted partners were given more freedom, while others had formal quality control gates established before contracts could be signed. The team then focused on over-delivering on the aspects that mattered most to the client, ensuring satisfaction even if initial expectations had to be reset. This feedback loop also informed which custom services should be productized into SaaS offerings.

### Managing Executive Stakeholders
*   **Communicating Value & ROI:** Executive communication is framed as "pitching a client." The focus is on quantifiable metrics and data-driven storytelling to remove emotion from decision-making. The goal is to present data so clearly that the desired direction feels like the executive's own idea. Informal, one-on-one check-ins are used to pre-vet ideas and gather feedback, ensuring there are no surprises in formal meetings.
*   **Challenging Example (SaaS Productization):** At Zebra, management was hesitant to turn a custom inventory management app for Walmart into a broader SaaS product.
    *   **Action:** A custom Power BI dashboard was built, integrating live data from sales, operational efficiency metrics, and ideal customer profiles. The dashboard clearly demonstrated the market opportunity and ROI for a SaaS play.
    *   **Result:** The data-driven story successfully swayed executive opinion. The project was greenlit and was subsequently sold as a SaaS solution to major clients like Disney. The dashboard became a dynamic storytelling tool, modified as needed based on stakeholder feedback to be more convincing over time.
