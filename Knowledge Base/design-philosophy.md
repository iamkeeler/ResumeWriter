Gary Keeler’s overall design philosophy centers on refining every user interaction point between a person and software with the purpose of enabling end users to succeed as effectively as possible. He applies design thinking tools to address business problems and believes a leader’s role includes spreading their design philosophy throughout their team to amplify impact.

The core principle guiding his design decisions is that the end user must always be at the heart of the work. Everything designed should benefit the user by streamlining their experience, delighting them, and encouraging ongoing engagement. If a project does not improve the user experience, it has missed its mark.

Balancing user needs with business goals and technical constraints is crucial. While the user is central, business objectives like conversion rates or revenue generation shape the workflows and paths designed to achieve success for both sides.

Gary sees user research as an essential component, whether detailed or quick, relying on techniques like user interviews and surveys to gather directional input that informs better decisions aligned with user needs.

Accessibility is personally important to him as a colorblind designer. Every asset and screen undergoes accessibility checks following the latest standards (such as WCAG 2.1). Inclusivity requires understanding the user base deeply to ensure respectful and empathetic design.

Collaboration across product managers, engineers, and stakeholders is integral. Gary ensures open communication, inclusion in critique and input opportunities, and alignment of goals, resulting in cohesive products that meet diverse group expectations.

To ensure design consistency and quality across platforms, he emphasizes brand and design guidelines, comprehensive design documentation, and scalable design systems with reusable components. This approach overcomes variability between multiple designers to produce unified user experiences.

For ideation, prototyping, and iteration, Gary favors brainstorming sessions, mind maps, Kanban boards, and quadrant-style prioritization balanced by desirability, feasibility, and effort. He values design sprints and workshops to drive rapid and effective outcomes.

Feedback and critique are welcomed openly as means to improve quality. While users may not always know what they want until shown, continuous user communication combined with insights and instinct helps uncover needs to be addressed.

A notable challenge Gary faced was unifying three separate software components for a platform at Ecolab. Using shared design systems, regular collaborative meetings, prototyping, and A/B testing enabled rapid course correction and cohesive outcomes consistent with his philosophy of teamwork and agility.

Gary adapts his design approach across industries—from consumer apps with millions of users to mandatory enterprise software to life-impacting healthcare tech—always tailoring to the user segment's needs and responsibilities.

Looking ahead, he sees AI-powered personalization as a major shift. Designers must integrate AI thoughtfully into both workflows and products to enhance beneficial experiences rather than merely holding user attention with generic outputs, positioning designers to lead in this evolving landscape.
