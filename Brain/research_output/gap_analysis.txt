CRITICAL GAPS (Priority 8-10):
- None. All high priority keywords have strong coverage.

SECONDARY GAPS (Priority 5-7):
- Consumer Subscription: While you have "Consumer Apps" (Craigslist app 4.5M downloads), the specific "Subscription" model experience isn't explicitly highlighted in recent main roles, though Zebra had a "recurring revenue model" (SaaS) which is similar.
- Identity-driven Experiences: No direct keyword match found in KB, though "Identity" in the context of Ancestry (Genealogy) is specific. "Healthcare/Medtech" deals with sensitive personal data which is a strong parallel.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Frame the Zebra "recurring revenue model" explicitly as a subscription-based model to bridge the "Consumer Subscription" gap.
2. Highlight the "Craigslist Browser" experience (4.5M downloads) to show Consumer scale, even if it wasn't subscription-based, it demonstrates consumer engagement.
3. Use the "Personal Branding" or "Genealogy" interest (if any, checking KB...) or the "Human-centered" aspect of healthcare to align with "Identity-driven".
