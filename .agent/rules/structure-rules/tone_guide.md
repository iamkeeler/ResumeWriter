# Resume Tone of Voice Guide

## Overview
This guide defines the tone, voice, and language standards for professional resume writing based on current best practices for 2025. Use this guide to ensure consistency, clarity, and ATS compatibility.

---

## Core Tone Principles

### Professional Yet Authentic
- Maintain formal business language while allowing personality to emerge through word choice
- Avoid overly stiff or robotic phrasing—write like a competent professional, not a thesaurus
- Let accomplishments speak for themselves without excessive self-promotion

### Confident and Direct
- State achievements with certainty and specificity
- Use active, decisive language that demonstrates ownership
- Avoid hedging words like "helped with," "assisted," or "was involved in"

### Results-Oriented
- Lead with outcomes and business impact, not tasks
- Focus on what you achieved, not just what you did
- Quantify whenever possible—numbers provide instant credibility

---

## Voice Guidelines

### Person and Pronouns
**DO:** Write in first-person implied (no pronouns)
- ✅ "Led cross-functional team of 12 designers"
- ✅ "Architected enterprise CRM system serving 50,000 users"

**DON'T:** Use "I," "my," "me," or other personal pronouns
- ❌ "I led a cross-functional team"
- ❌ "My responsibilities included..."

### Sentence Structure
**DO:** Use concise, punchy fragments
- ✅ "Drove 40% increase in conversion rates through A/B testing"
- ✅ "Scaled design team from 2 to 8 members in 12 months"

**DON'T:** Write full sentences with subjects
- ❌ "I was responsible for driving a 40% increase..."
- ❌ "The team that I managed grew from 2 to 8 members"

### Verb Tense
**Current roles:** Present tense
- ✅ "Lead enterprise product strategy"
- ✅ "Manage $18M software portfolio"

**Past roles:** Past tense
- ✅ "Led design practice serving 100+ enterprise clients"
- ✅ "Established user research program"

**Be consistent** within each role—don't mix tenses

### Quantification: Numbers Tell the Story
Use specific metrics to demonstrate scale and impact.

### Keyword Integration: Natural and Strategic
Incorporate industry-specific terms and job description keywords organically.

**DO:** Weave keywords into achievement statements
- ✅ "Implemented Figma design system with atomic design methodology, enabling 50% faster shipping velocity"
  - *Keywords: Figma, design system, atomic design*

**DON'T:** Stuff keywords unnaturally or create keyword lists in bullets
- ❌ "Responsible for Figma, design systems, atomic design, velocity improvements"

**Placement priority:**
1. Summary section (3-5 critical keywords)
2. Job titles and role descriptions
3. Bullet point accomplishments
4. Skills section (organized by category)

---

## Formatting Best Practices

### Consistency is Critical
**Dates:** Use uniform format
- ✅ "March 2023 - Present" OR "Mar 2023 - Present" OR "2023 - Present"
- Pick one format and use it throughout

**Bullet points:** Use same style throughout
- ✅ All dashes (-) OR all bullets (•)
- Don't mix styles

**Capitalization:**
- Job titles: Title Case (e.g., "Director of User Experience")
- Section headers: ALL CAPS or Title Case—be consistent
- Company names: Match official capitalization

### Punctuation
**Bullet points:**
- No periods if bullets are fragments (preferred)
- Use periods if any bullet is a complete sentence (then all get periods)
- Be consistent across entire resume

**Commas and semicolons:**
- Use Oxford comma in lists: "design, product, and engineering"
- Avoid semicolons—use bullets instead for lists

---

## Section-Specific Tone

### Summary / Professional Summary
**Length:** 2-3 sentences maximum
**Tone:** Confident, strategic, high-level
**Content:** Title + Years + Domains + Top 1-2 achievements

**Example:**
"Strategic product and marketing leader with 14+ years bridging UX design, enterprise software, and digital healthcare innovation. Proven ability to scale teams 300%, drive $55M pipeline value, and establish design cultures at enterprise scale."

**Pattern:**
[Role] + [Experience] + [Domain expertise] + [Quantified proof points]

---

### Experience Bullets
**Tone:** Achievement-focused, specific, results-driven
**Structure:** Action + Context + Result

**Strong examples:**
- ✅ "Architected website redesign aligned with 10x lead generation goal, achieving 1400% conversion improvement and 3x traffic increase within 6 months"
  - *Action: Architected*
  - *Context: aligned with 10x goal*
  - *Result: 1400% conversion, 3x traffic, 6 months*

- ✅ "Established design critique culture across 3 business units serving 700+ employees, reducing design iteration cycles by 30%"
  - *Action: Established*
  - *Context: across 3 BUs, 700 employees*
  - *Result: 30% reduction*

**Weak examples:**
- ❌ "Responsible for website redesign efforts"
- ❌ "Helped improve team culture"
- ❌ "Worked with stakeholders on various projects"

---

### Skills Section
**Tone:** Organized, scannable, keyword-rich
**Format:** Categorized lists (not sentences)

**Example:**
```
SKILLS

Product & Strategy
Product Strategy Development | Product Roadmap Development | Go-to-Market Strategy | Feature Prioritization | Competitive Analysis

Design & UX
User Experience Design | Design Systems | Figma | Prototyping | User Research | Information Architecture | Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

Leadership & Operations
Team Scaling | Cross-Functional Collaboration | Agile/Scrum | Stakeholder Management | Design Operations
```

**Use:** Pipes (|) or bullets (•) between skills—not commas
**Avoid:** Rating systems (bars, stars) or vague "proficiency levels"

---

## What to Avoid

### Language Pitfalls
❌ **Passive voice:** "Was responsible for," "Was tasked with"
✅ **Active voice:** "Led," "Managed," "Delivered"

❌ **Clichés:** "Team player," "Detail-oriented," "Results-driven" (as standalone phrases)
✅ **Specific examples:** Demonstrate these qualities through achievements

❌ **Jargon overload:** "Synergized cross-functional alignment to optimize stakeholder engagement"
✅ **Clear language:** "Aligned product, design, and engineering teams on quarterly roadmap"

❌ **Vague claims:** "Significantly improved performance"
✅ **Specific metrics:** "Improved page load time by 60% (3.2s to 1.3s)"

### Tone Mistakes
❌ **Overly humble:** "Assisted with" / "Helped the team"
✅ **Ownership:** "Led" / "Delivered" / "Drove"

❌ **Overly boastful:** "Single-handedly revolutionized the industry"
✅ **Confident realism:** "Established company's first design system, adopted across 5 product teams"

❌ **Robotic/Generic:** "Utilized best practices to achieve optimal outcomes"
✅ **Human/Specific:** "Applied atomic design methodology to reduce component inconsistencies by 75%"

---

## ATS Compatibility Checklist

✅ Use standard section headers: SUMMARY, EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION
✅ Avoid tables, text boxes, columns, headers/footers
✅ Use standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman
✅ Save as .docx or simple PDF (not image-based PDF)
✅ Integrate keywords naturally throughout
✅ Use standard bullet points (• or -)

---

## Reference Examples

### WEAK Bullet (Before)
"Responsible for managing the design team and working with stakeholders on various projects to improve the user experience."

**Issues:**
- Passive voice ("responsible for")
- Weak verb ("working with")
- Vague ("various projects," "improve")
- No metrics or results

### STRONG Bullet (After)

**Improvements:**
✅ Strong action verb ("Led")
