## Core Tone Principles

### Confident and Direct
- State achievements with certainty and specificity
- Use active, decisive language that demonstrates ownership
- Avoid hedging words like "helped with," "assisted," or "was involved in"

### Results-Oriented
- Lead with outcomes and business impact, not tasks
- Focus on what you achieved, not just what you did
- Quantify whenever possible—numbers provide instant credibility

## Formatting Best Practices

- Pick one format and use it throughout

**Bullet points:** Use same style throughout
- ✅ All dashes (-) OR all bullets (•)
- Don't mix styles

**Capitalization:**
- Job titles: Title Case (e.g., "Director of User Experience")
- Section headers: ALL CAPS or Title Case—be consistent
- Company names: Match official capitalization

### Punctuation
**Bullet points:**
- No periods if bullets are fragments (preferred)
- Use periods if any bullet is a complete sentence (then all get periods)
- Be consistent across entire resume

**Commas and semicolons:**
- Use Oxford comma in lists: "design, product, and engineering"
- Avoid semicolons—use bullets instead for lists
