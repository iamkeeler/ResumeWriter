- Skills section with exact tool/platform names
- Target 85+ ATS score if possible with accurate data

**Authenticity Rules:**

- Never fabricate metrics or experiences
- Never change job titles
- Only use data from actual work history, reworded for context
- Write in your voice (first-person implied, not "Gary did X" but "Led X")

**Output Format:**

- Markdown code block for easy copy/paste
- Standard keyboard characters only
- Hyperlinks formatted as [text](url)
- Clean, readable structure
