## Key Principles

**Bullet Writing Pattern:**
"**Bolded initiative** + context + Result: metric"

**Skills Placement:**
Bottom of resume, organized by category

**Length:**
2-3 pages ideal; experience bullets are detailed with metrics

**ATS Optimization:**
- Use keywords from job description naturally throughout
- Standard section headers (SUMMARY, EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, SKILLS)
- Clean formatting without tables or complex layouts
- Target 85+ ATS score with accurate data

**Authenticity Rules:**
- Never fabricate metrics or experiences
- Never change job titles
- Only use data from actual work history, reworded for context
- Write in your voice (first-person implied: "Led X" not "Gary led X")

**Output Format:**
- Markdown for easy copy/paste
- Standard keyboard characters only
- URLs shown as full text (e.g., linkedin.com/in/username)
- Clean, readable structure
