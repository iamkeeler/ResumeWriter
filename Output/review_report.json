    "summary": "Strong resume for U.S. Bank AI PM. Agentic AI experience is exact match for role. LLM integration, product launches ($6M ARR), and cross-functional collaboration all directly address JD. Self-starter narrative reinforced with Inc. 30 Under 30 and startup experience. Minor industry gaps (freight/banking) mitigated by enterprise B2B scale (Amazon, Walmart, Disney clients)."
