About Ancestry

When you join Ancestry, you join a human-centered company where every person’s story is important. Ancestry®, the global leader in family history, connects everyone with their past so they can discover, preserve, and share their unique family stories. With our unparalleled collection of more than 65 billion records, over 3.5 million subscribers, and over 27 million people in our growing DNA network, customers can discover their family story and gain a new level of understanding about their lives. Over the past 40 years, we’ve built trusted relationships with millions of people who have chosen us as the platform for discovering, preserving, and sharing the most important information about themselves and their families.

We are committed to our location flexible work approach, allowing you to choose to work in the nearest office, from your home, or a hybrid of both (subject to location restrictions and roles that are required to be in the office- see the full list of eligible US locations HERE). We will continue to hire and promote beyond the boundaries of our office locations, to enable broadened possibilities for employee diversity.

Together, we work every day to foster a work environment that's inclusive as well as diverse, and where our people can be themselves. Every idea and perspective is valued so that our products and services reflect the global and diverse clients we serve.

Ancestry encourages applications from minorities, women, the disabled, protected veterans and all other qualified applicants. Passionate about dedicating your work to enriching people’s lives? Join the curious.

At Ancestry, we’re all about helping people discover, preserve, and share their family stories. If you want to join a collaborative, mission-driven team focused on delivering meaningful experiences at scale, we’re growing — and we’d love to meet you.

We’re looking for a Director of UX to lead our End-to-End Experience team — a cross-functional group focused on making the customer journey seamless across every interaction, channel, and product surface. This is a rare opportunity to shape how millions of users discover and engage with their family history through cohesive, intuitive, and deeply meaningful experiences. You’ll report to the Head of Design for the Core Product, and work closely with peers across product, design, engineering, research, content, marketing, and customer support. Your job is to ensure every step of the customer journey — from onboarding and discovery to upgrades and long-term engagement — feels thoughtfully connected and optimized.

Ancestry serves millions of customers globally. Your leadership will help unify our ecosystem of products into a seamless experience that builds trust, reinforces value, and empowers people to explore their identities and family stories. You’ll join a highly collaborative environment that values curiosity, clarity, and a deep commitment to customer understanding. We offer a flexible, hybrid culture with a strong focus on work/life balance — so you can grow your career while staying grounded in what matters most.
